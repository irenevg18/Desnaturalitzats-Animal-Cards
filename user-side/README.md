# Briefing
The main **objective** of this project is to increase and complement the information of the animals and regions that appears in the Desnaturalitzats documentaries.

The app is divided in two parts: the **user** and the **admin** sides.

- `HOW THE USER SIDE LOOKS LIKE`
**missing** a view with the list of all the animals there are in each region.
